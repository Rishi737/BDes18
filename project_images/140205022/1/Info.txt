Brief : This project aims to help offline shoppers(those shopping at physical locations) to split offers such as buy 1 get 1 
free, with fellow shoppers shopping at same/nearby location by matching them based on deals which both wish to split.
This will also enhance the communication among the shoppers who are in search of someone to split the deal with.
